This is the readme for my github repository for this project. This project was worked on throughout the Sprng 2016 semester as the final project for the course Software Engineering, taught by Dr. Brian Ladd at SUNY Potsdam. I was one of six team members working on this project. My contributions can been seen specifically by looking at the commit history, but most of my work was on src/main/java/LogicalBoard.java, alongside my partner Craig. Most, if not all of the unit testing for LogicalBoard (src/test/java/LogicalBoardTest.java) was written by me. I also wrote all of the comments for LogicalBoard to keep things organized and javadoc-compliant.

We used Agile development with one-week sprints to create this project.
