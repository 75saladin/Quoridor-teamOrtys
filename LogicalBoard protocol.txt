Instantiate:
    LogicalBoard b = new LogicalBoard(int playerNumber);
    
    Player number is either 2 or 4. The board gets populated with the players 
    in the locations specified by Dr. Ladd's protocol.txt. Players are
    identified by their number, 1-4.

Check a move:
    b.validMove(int playerNumber, String move);

    Returns a boolean representing whether or not the given move is valid for
    the given player. Move format: "<c> <r>", where <c> is a digit representing
    column number and <r> is a digit representing row number.
    If it returns false, the move will not be made. If it returns true, the
    move will automatically be made on the board.

Check a wall:
    b.validWall(int playerNumber, String wall);

    Returns a boolean representing whether or not the given wall is valid for
    the given player. Wall format: "<c> <r> <d>", where <c> is a digit 
    representing column number, <r> is a digit representing row number, and <d>
    is a case-insensitive single character, either "v" or "h", representing 
    wall direction.
    If it returns false, the wall will not be placed. If it returns true, the
    wall will automatically be placed on the board.
