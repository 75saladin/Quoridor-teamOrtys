possibilities for gui

- remove the vertical and horizontal gaps
- make a directional pad for the player
- add dropShadow effect for the nodes
- need a check turn and check move for validity
- use methods to create events for cleaner code
- click the square to create a wall

Currently the GUI is a 17 x 17 gridPane. The rectangles are nodes. 
The gridpane is on top of a pane.
